Interesting thing about the chat app


jsut to communicate with the client side we can use callback function from the server side which will carry error obj from server to client .So in case of joining a new user to the join room if there is any error we will send a
call back fucntion to the client side client side will give us a flash message that it is an error u cant join  


if we want to change the webpage on the client side we can simply use 

location.href="/" to go to home page
